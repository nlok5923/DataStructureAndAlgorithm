//type of tries 

// reason of choosing trie over hashmap for making dictionary
//1) Space complexity : space optimisation
//2) fast searching 

// two different types of tries 

// 1) Compressed tries : major motivation :  space optimisation 
// just club those node from which there no further branches (generally)
//  remove isTerminal property in case you need to add functionality of pattern matching
// in patten matching we are not able to find suffizx of the word 
// for solving above problem we will be using suffix trie

// suffix trie in which for each work we will save each possible siffix of the word 
// for patten matching we will be using suffix tries
